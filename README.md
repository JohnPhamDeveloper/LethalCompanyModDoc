## Networking

In order to write our own network code from Unity, we need to utilize NetWeaver: https://github.com/EvaisaDev/UnityNetcodeWeaver.

In visual studio code 2022, Right click project solution > Build (left panel) > Advanced... > Set debugging information to "Portable". Failing to do this step will result in the netcode patcher failing.
